        Hello, and thank you for taking a second to visit my website! <br><br>
        I'm just starting my adventure pursuing a Master's of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) after wrapping up my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) majoring in both CS and Statistics. <br><br>
        I'm an aspiring AI researcher, and my coursework includes Stochastic Reinforcement Learning, and Computer Vision and Language. I'm familiar with Python, R, JavaScript, Java, C++/C, HTML, and CSS. <br><br> 
        Currently, I'm work at UIUC under my advisor, Dr. Hanghang Tong, on graph neural networks (GNNs) and their extensions. I'm particularly excited to explore the explainability and robustness of these models. (That is, can we make a GNN not a black-box and susceptible to noisy data?)<br><br>
        Previously as an undergraduate, I was a part of UNC's LUPA Lab, where I collaborated with Professor Junier Oliva and other graduate students to work on high-level feature acquisition modeling inside of reinforcement learning policies. <br><br>
        I'm working on my MSCS from August 2022 to May 2024 and am looking to obtain an internship for the Summer of 2023!<br><br>
        Thanks for reading this quick blurb about me! Check out my social profiles below for more.
