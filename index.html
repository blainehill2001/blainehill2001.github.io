        Hello, and thank you for taking a second to visit my website! <br><br>

        I'm just starting my adventure pursuing a Master's of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) after wrapping up my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) majoring in both CS and Statistics. <br><br>

        I'm an aspiring interdisciplinary AI researcher, and my coursework includes Stochastic Reinforcement Learning, Transfer Learning, and Computer Vision and Language. I'm familiar with Python, R, JavaScript, Java, C++/C, HTML, and CSS. <br><br>

        Currently, I'm work under my advisor, <a href="http://tonghanghang.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Hanghang Tong</a> at the iDEA Lab, tackling various knowledge graph reasoning tasks. I'm particularly excited to explore the explainability and robustness of these models. (That is, can we locate an agent that whose actions aren't given by a black-box and susceptible to noisy environment measurements?)<br><br>
        
        At UIUC, I am a part of <a href="https://www.quantillinois.com/" target="_blank">Quant @ Illinois</a>, an esteemed student-run quantitative finance club where I am a part of the research team and and making use of large language models to create trading strategies. <br><br>

        Previously as an undergraduate, I was a part of UNC's <a href="https://sites.google.com/cs.unc.edu/lupalab" target="_blank">LUPA Lab</a>, where I collaborated with Professor Junier Oliva and other graduate students to work on derivative free optimization inside of reinforcement learning applications. <br><br>

        I'm working on my MSCS from August 2022 to May 2024 and am looking to obtain an internship for the Summer of 2024 !<br><br>

        Thanks for reading this quick blurb about me! Check out my social profiles below for more.
